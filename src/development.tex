\chapter{Development Stack}

In this chapter we provide the general overview of our workflow and
development stack.

\section{Version Control System}
Our VCS of choice is \textbf{Git}, and our repositories are hosted on 
\textbf{GitHub}. Being the most popular service, GitHub is well integrated 
with many developer tools such as Golangâ€™s \texttt{go get} and various 
Continuous Integration systems. On top of that, we use common GitHub features 
for managing current tasks and project development.

\subsection{Workflow}
We follow a fairly standard git workflow. New features are developed on 
separate branches, branched directly off of \texttt{master}. Once the code 
is ready, the branch is pushed to our central GitHub repository and code 
review is requested from other team members. After positive feedback from 
the CI system and two approvals, the pull request is merged to the 
\texttt{master} branch. To retain a linear git history, all feature branches 
are rebased onto the \texttt{master} branch before merging.

\section{Continuous integration}

\subsection{Travis}
\textbf{Travis CI}~\cite{travis} is a hosted service (free for open source 
projects). Unlike many other services, it does not require server---side 
configuration, but relies only on \texttt{.travis.yml} files placed inside 
the project source directory. This makes it easy to have different test 
code per branch and removes the necessity to manage permissions separately 
for the repository and for the CI system. Travis integrates easily with the 
tools used in our project (GitHub and Slack). Along with Travis CI, we have 
decided to use \textbf{Coveralls}~\cite{coveralls} --- a web service that 
tracks code coverage\footnote{the degree to which the source code of a~program 
is executed when a particular test suite runs} over time, and ensures that 
all new code is fully covered by tests.

\subsection{Kubernetes Cluster}
To perform integration tests during the continuous integration process we 
have decided to use \textbf{Minikube}~\cite{minikube} --- a lightweight
Kubernetes implementation that creates a VM on the local machine and deploys 
a simple cluster containing only one node.

\subsection{Continuous Deployment}
The Docker image built from the \texttt{master} branch is automatically 
deployed to \textbf{DockerHub}~\cite{docker}. This way users can download
and use our project easily as a docker image. Each stable version of our 
project is manually added and reflects a specific git commit.

\section{Communication}
As our communication tool, we have chosen \textbf{Slack}~\cite{slack} --- 
a modern IRC---like communicator. Slack features persistent chat rooms
(channels) organized by topic, comes with a large number of third---party 
services, and supports community---built integrations.
